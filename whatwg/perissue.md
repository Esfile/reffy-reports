Not all specifications define IDL content, presence in this list may be completely normal. Reffy's current focus is on IDL specifications, the number of specifications listed here should remain minimal.


## List of specifications with invalid WebIDL content

- [CSS Font Loading Module Level 3](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-font-loading/)

=> 125 inconsistent references for links found in 54 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
