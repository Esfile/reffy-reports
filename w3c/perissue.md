=> 37 specifications found


## Specifications without normative dependencies

- [Page not found Â· GitHub Pages](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html)
- [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html)

=> 2 specifications found

Basically all specifications have normative dependencies on some other specification. Reffy could not find any normative dependencies for the specifications mentioned above, which seems strange.


## Specifications without WebIDL definitions

- [Compositing and Blending Level 1](https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/)
- [CSS Syntax Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/)
- [CSS Values and Units Module Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/)
- [CSS Writing Modes Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-3/)
- [Mixed Content](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-mixed-content/)
- [Page not found Â· GitHub Pages](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html)
- [Selectors Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/)
- [Streams Standard](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/)
- [UI Events KeyboardEvent code Values](https://w3c.github.io/uievents-code/)
- [UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values](https://w3c.github.io/uievents-key/)

=> 10 specifications found

Not all specifications define IDL content, presence in this list may be completely normal. Reffy's current focus is on IDL specifications, the number of specifications listed here should remain minimal.


## List of specifications with invalid WebIDL content

- [CSS Fonts Module Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/)
- [CSS Layout API Level 1](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-layout-api-1/)
- [HTML 5.3](https://w3c.github.io/html/)
- [Metadata API for Media Resources 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-api-1.0/)
- [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 2](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/)
- [The WebSocket API](https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/)
- [User Interface Security and the Visibility API](http://w3c.github.io/webappsec-uisecurity/index.html)

=> 7 specifications found

WebIDL continues to evolve. Reffy may incorrectly report as invalid perfectly valid WebIDL content if the specification uses bleeding-edge WebIDL features


## List of specifications with obsolete WebIDL constructs

- [HTML5 Web Messaging](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-webmessaging-20150519/)

=> 1 specification found

A typical example is the use of `[]` instead of `FrozenArray`.


## Specifications that use WebIDL but do not reference the WebIDL spec

- [Referrer Policy](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/)
- [Selectors API Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/)
- [UI Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-uievents-20160804/)
- [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html)

=> 4 specifications found

Also, please keep in mind that Reffy only knows about IDL terms defined in the specifications that were crawled **and** that do not have invalid IDL content.

=> 116 inconsistent references for links found in 41 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
