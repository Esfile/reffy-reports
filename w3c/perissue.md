% June 04, 2018

148 specifications were crawled in this report.


## Specifications that could not be rendered

Reffy could not fetch or render these specifications for some reason. This may happen when a network error occurred or when a specification uses an old version of ReSpec.

- [requestidlecallback](https://www.w3.org/TR/requestidlecallback/): `TypeError: Cannot read property 'version-history' of undefined TypeError: Cannot read property 'version-history' of undefined
    at fetch.then.then.s (/home/dom/github.com/reffy/src/cli/crawl-specs.js:156:34)
    at <anonymous>
    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)`

=> 1 specification found


## Specifications that do not link to an Editor's Draft

- [Geolocation API Specification 2nd Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/)
- [HTML Canvas 2D Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/)
- [Metadata API for Media Resources 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-api-1.0/)
- [Selectors API Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/)
- [Selectors Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/)
- [The WebSocket API](https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/)
- [Web Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/)

=> 7 specifications found

It is good practice to link to Editor's Draft for W3C specifications even for specifications published as Recommendations. Reffy (or rather the W3C API) could not find a link to an Editor's Draft for the specifications mentioned above.


## Specifications without normative dependencies

- [Payment Method: Basic Card](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-basic-card/)
- [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html)

=> 2 specifications found

Basically all specifications have normative dependencies on some other specification. Reffy could not find any normative dependencies for the specifications mentioned above, which seems strange.


## Specifications without WebIDL definitions

- [Accessibility Object Model](https://wicg.github.io/aom/spec/)
- [Compositing and Blending Level 1](https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/)
- [ContentEditable](https://w3c.github.io/editing/contentEditable.html)
- [CSS Syntax Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/)
- [CSS Values and Units Module Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/)
- [CSS Writing Modes Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-3/)
- [Mixed Content](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-mixed-content/)
- [Preload](https://w3c.github.io/preload/)
- [Selectors Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/)
- [Streams Standard](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/)
- [UI Events KeyboardEvent code Values](https://w3c.github.io/uievents-code/)
- [UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values](https://w3c.github.io/uievents-key/)

=> 12 specifications found

Not all specifications define IDL content, presence in this list may be completely normal. Reffy's current focus is on IDL specifications, the number of specifications listed here should remain minimal.


## List of specifications with invalid WebIDL content

- [CSS Layout API Level 1](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-layout-api-1/)
- [HTML 5.3](https://w3c.github.io/html/)
- [Metadata API for Media Resources 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-api-1.0/)
- [Resize Observer 1](https://wicg.github.io/ResizeObserver/)
- [The WebSocket API](https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/)
- [User Interface Security and the Visibility API](http://w3c.github.io/webappsec-uisecurity/index.html)

=> 6 specifications found

WebIDL continues to evolve. Reffy may incorrectly report as invalid perfectly valid WebIDL content if the specification uses bleeding-edge WebIDL features


## List of specifications with obsolete WebIDL constructs

- [HTML5 Web Messaging](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-webmessaging-20150519/)

=> 1 specification found

A typical example is the use of `[]` instead of `FrozenArray`.


## Specifications that use WebIDL but do not reference the WebIDL spec

=> 48 WebIDL names found

Some of them may be type errors in specs (e.g. "int" does not exist, "Array" cannot be used on its own, etc.)
Also, please keep in mind that Reffy only knows about IDL terms defined in the specifications that were crawled **and** that do not have invalid IDL content.

=> 163 inconsistent references for links found in 77 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
